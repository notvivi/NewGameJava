Hello my friend,

    From today, youre no longer pokemon trainer, because of some horrible accident.
    Pokemons has started to hate us, humans.
    We dont know why, but our best doctors and ex-trainers are trying to explore as much as they can.
    Right now we have only few leads.
    Let me tell you.
    Rocket leaders are using pokemons hatred to get revenge against humanity.
    You have to stop them.
    At first, you have to catch all pokemons you meet on your journey.
    Then go from gym to gym that pokemons are possesing right now and win against them.
    If you have ten badgets in total, you can have match against Rocket Leaders and their pet Meow.

        Good luck,
        Vivi
